    "option_b": "Approximately 10-11 threads (about 5/8 inch)",
    "option_c": "20 threads",
    "option_d": "Full thread engagement — all threads must be in the fitting",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "For a 1-inch NPS threaded pipe, approximately 10-11 threads of engagement are required, which is about 5/8 inch. NPT (National Pipe Thread) is a tapered thread, and proper engagement ensures a tight, leak-free seal without over-tightening.",
    "wrong_explanations": "A) 3 threads would not provide adequate engagement for a leak-free seal. C) 20 threads would require forcing the pipe too far into the fitting, potentially cracking the fitting. D) NPT tapered threads are designed so that not all threads engage; attempting full engagement would damage the fitting.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A concentric reducer has both openings centered on the same axis, resulting in a cone shape. An eccentric reducer has one side flat, which maintains either the top or bottom of pipe (BOP) at the same elevation. Eccentric reducers are used in horizontal runs to prevent air pockets or allow drainage.",
