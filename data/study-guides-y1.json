    "content": "## Workplace Safety and Rigging - Year 2\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n**Confined Space Entry Procedures**\n- Journeyman responsibilities for confined space work\n- Atmospheric monitoring requirements\n- Rescue planning and attendant duties\n- Permit-required space protocols\n\n**Intermediate Hazard Assessment**\n- Beyond basic hazard identification\n- Risk assessment for complex scenarios\n- Emergency response procedures for intermediate workers\n\n**Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Procedures**\n- Advanced energy isolation methods\n- Group lockout procedures\n- Verification and testing requirements\n\n### Practice Questions:\n\n### Question 1\n**Question:** What is the primary responsibility of a journeyman when working in confined spaces?\n**Options:**\n- A) To monitor atmospheric conditions and ensure proper ventilation\n- B) To serve as the designated attendant outside the confined space\n- C) To perform the work and maintain communication with the attendant\n- D) To complete all required documentation before entering\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** The journeyman working inside the confined space must be able to focus on the work while the attendant monitors conditions and maintains safety. The attendant's role is specifically to provide emergency assistance and ensure proper ventilation, making option B the correct answer for the worker's primary responsibility.\n**Reference:** AIT Period 2 Curriculum\n\n### Question 2\n**Question:** Which type of fire requires a Class A fire extinguisher?\n**Options:**\n- A) Electrical fires involving energized equipment\n- B) Ordinary combustibles like wood, paper, or cloth\n- C) Flammable liquids such as gasoline or oil\n- D) Combustible metals like magnesium or titanium\n**Correct Answer:** A\n**Explanation:** Class A fire extinguishers are specifically designed for electrical fires and use non-conductive extinguishing agents. Using water-based extinguishers (Class B) on electrical fires can cause electrocution, while Class A extinguishers use dry chemical agents safe for electrical equipment.\n**Reference:** AIT Period 2 Curriculum\n\n### Question 3\n**Question:** What is the minimum required oxygen concentration in a confined space before entry?\n**Options:**\n- A) 19.5% oxygen\n- B) 21% oxygen\n- C) 23.5% oxygen\n- D) 15.5% oxygen\n**Correct Answer:** A\n**Explanation:** 19.5% is the minimum oxygen concentration required for safe entry into confined spaces. Below this level, oxygen deficiency can occur, leading to impaired judgment, unconsciousness, and potentially death. Higher oxygen levels (21-23.5%) can actually increase fire risk.\n**Reference:** AIT Period 2 Curriculum"

    "content": "## Tools, Equipment and Materials - Year 2\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n**Welding Processes for Carbon Steel**\n- MIG vs TIG applications for pipe welding\n- Proper filler material selection\n- Heat input considerations for different wall thicknesses\n\n**Advanced Tool Operations**\n- Power tool maintenance and inspection\n- Cutting equipment setup and optimization\n- Tool selection for specific materials\n\n**Intermediate Pipe Applications**\n- Material compatibility considerations\n- Pressure testing procedures\n- Advanced joining techniques\n\n### Practice Questions:\n\n### Question 1\n**Question:** What type of welding process is commonly used for joining carbon steel pipe?\n**Options:**\n- A) TIG (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding)\n- B) MIG (Gas Metal Arc Welding)\n- C) SMAW (Shielded Metal Arc Welding)\n- D) FCAW (Flux-Cored Arc Welding)\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** MIG welding is the most commonly used process for carbon steel pipe in pipefitting due to its versatility, speed, and ease of use. TIG is used for precision work, SMAW for heavy structural applications, and FCAW for outdoor or position welding.\n**Reference:** AIT Period 2 Curriculum\n\n### Question 2\n**Question:** What is the primary purpose of using pipe dope when threading pipe?\n**Options:**\n- A) To lubricate the threads\n- B) To clean the threads before assembly\n- C) To prevent corrosion during assembly\n- D) To seal the connection after assembly\n**Correct Answer:** A\n**Explanation:** Pipe dope is primarily a lubricant that reduces friction during threading, preventing galling and ensuring proper thread engagement. While cleaning and corrosion prevention are secondary benefits, lubrication is the main purpose for smooth thread creation.\n**Reference:** AIT Period 2 Curriculum"

Complete penetration prevents joint failure and ensures the full design strength of the weldment.\n**Reference:** AIT Period 2 Curriculum\n\n### Question 2\n**Question:** What does the abbreviation 'MIG' stand for?\n**Options:**\n- A) Metal Inert Gas\n- B) Metal Active Gas\n- C) Manual Inert Gas\n- D) Machine Inert Gas\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** MIG stands for Metal Inert Gas, referring to the shielding gas (typically argon or CO2 mix) used to protect the weld pool from atmospheric contamination. This distinguishes it from processes using different shielding methods.\n**Reference:** AIT Period 2 Curriculum"
